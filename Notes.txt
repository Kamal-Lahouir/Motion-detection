About background:
The background in the first frame is actually more efficient when it is in white. For a better view we need a white background and a dark color item.

Algorithm: 
- FIRST_FRAME into Grayscale
- For FRAME in VIDEO:
    Grayscale(Actual_frame)
    Difference with the FIRST_FRAME
    Detection of contours in the difference
    Draw of the rectangle
